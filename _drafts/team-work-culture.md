I don't think I have enough experience to write about this topic. But still I like to describe team/work culture according to me.
To me team culture is not having

* cool gaming stations in office
* not the hover board
* not the refrigerator with food
* not having a cool office

Rather I like to describe it as attitude of each and everyone work there. When the attitude of people become bad towards the work obviously we will have a bad culture or may be we force everyone to be strict and punctual which will slowly become a bad culture.

When it come to strict office employees are not allowed to work from anywhere they want any time they like comes under bad culture. The management is forced to this because some people with bad attitude misused those. Thus a team/work culture starts from hiring te right people.

You have. Ashik load of employees with bad attitude and have a cool office, people say cool office not great culture. Culture totally depends own attitude and not in the office exteriors or gaming stations.
