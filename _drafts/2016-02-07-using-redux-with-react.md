This is planned as part 2 of [What I learned after buliding first web app with react]() post because I believe one of the biggest mistake I did was not investing much time in redux and went for states in components.

Even though I heard of flux architecture nad uni directional data flow long back I didn't really understand the concept and why we need it. But recently I got my hands on the redux and now I know why we shouldn't be using component level states in react application.
