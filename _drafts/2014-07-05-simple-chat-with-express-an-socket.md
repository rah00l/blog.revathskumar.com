I always wondered how this chat application works in realtime. we just enter some text and send, the right next moment it reaches the other end. From the first time I heard of socket.io, It was in mind that I should build a simple chat application.

Here I use [socket.io](http://socket.io) and [express.js](http://expressjs.com).
