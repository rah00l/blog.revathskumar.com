<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">If you are attempting to do something on the change event of radio button or checkbox. Then u will notice that the change event won't fire in IE but works fine in Firefox and other browsers.<br /><br />The only solution is that if the browser is IE then u need to use <b>click</b> event instead of change <b>event</b>.But the click event will fire the action if we click on the same radio button which is checked.<br /><br />You may use this hack to make change event work on IE.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/3454796.js?file=sample.js"></script></div>
