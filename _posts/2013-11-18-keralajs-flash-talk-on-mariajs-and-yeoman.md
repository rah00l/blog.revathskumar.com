# Summary

This is just a summary of my unprepard flash talk on [MariaJS](http://peter.michaux.ca/maria/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) in [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org) meetup. I was really happy that I am able to introduce MariaJS and Yeoman to community. Most of them were already heard and used about Yeoman, But MariaJS was really new to everyone. I started my talk with **What's MariaJS** and **How it's different from other MV\* frameworks**. My intension was not to start a debate on JS frameworks, but rather make them understand other JS frameworks availabe now are not MVC.

# MariaJS

Since there were no slides, I was not able to share them who is behind and where you can find the docs and more details of it. Please find those details below.

# Yeoman

Yeoman helps you to generate bootstap for your application. You can turn your idea into prototype within in 10 mins and no more manual setup for your project. Yeoman will create directory structure, bootstrap files, download libraries for you.

If you want, you can take a look into my presentation from [Kerala Ruby User Group](http://krug.github.io) meetup in August 2013.
