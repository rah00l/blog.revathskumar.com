Its almost 2 months after the [first meetup](http://keralajs.org/2013/10/28/keralajs-first-meetup-summary) of [KeralaJS](http://keralajs.org/). But I totally forgot to share my slides of my talk **Promises in JavaScript** here. 

In this talk I tried to summarize the following points.

 * Introduction to Promises
 * How to use in browser environment
 * jQuery.when() promises with jQuery
