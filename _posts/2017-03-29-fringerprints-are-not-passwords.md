## Why Fingerprints are not passwords?

What you do when your GMail or facebook account compromised? 
You change your passwords, right?

Now consider your Gmail and Facebook is protected with your fingerprint.
Now when they those accounts are compromised, are you going to get more new fingers?

Password are some thing which should be able to update time to time and unique. 
You have seen that most bank portals will force users to change the passwords after a interval. 
And they insist that never reuse the password which you used some where else.

Now when you lock you phone, apps and payments using fingerprint you are literally using the same password
in all the places and this password is something you can't change.

## How secure is Fingerprint based authentication?

For the sake of argument, you can say that finger print can't be faked, but reality wont agree.
Locking you phone with fingerprint is like keeping a written pass code along with the phone.

We have already saw that [Hackers fakes German minister's fingerprints using photos of her hands](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/30/hacker-fakes-german-ministers-fingerprints-using-photos-of-her-hands). 

May that was a great work by some hackers, but in India fingerprints where [faked by sim card sales people](https://twitter.com/no2uid/status/832871156969410561) to show high sales.

Fingerprint is something which we leave everywhere you touch your phone, wallet, door 
handle you name it, that means you are advertising that here is my password everywhere and 
use the same to secure everything.

## What Google says about fingerprint security? 

In the [help of pixel phone](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/6300638) Google warn users
that `fingerprint may be less secure than a strong PIN, pattern or password`.

## Conclusion

Your fingerprints can't replace `passwords`, It's meant for identification not for **Authentication** and **Authorizations**.
If you are using fingerprints to secure you data without any password or two factor auth then your data is highly vulnerable to compromise.

Use fingerprints as **usernames**, not passwords.
