This was one of the error occoured for me while using fedora 8. once i given <b>yum update</b> command to update the whole system.After that when i try to update any software it shows the error "<b>No package marked for update</b>".After this yum update it stoped showing new update information on the panel.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So i done a lot of googling find the solution.It is because the repolist is not enabled.Then let me show how i enabled it.<br /><br />1. open the terminal and get into super user mode.<br />2. run the command <b>yum clean all</b>.<br />3. run the command <b>yum repolist enabled</b>.<br /><br /><br />I would like to make get comment to better my blog.<br />So please leave a comment
