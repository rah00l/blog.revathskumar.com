<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tutorial will help you to work on remember me option on login page. Here I will show the simplest way to create the remember me option in sinatra. Since the topic is about adding a remember me option, I am not going to take care of the authentication logic. If your application need better logic you can go for it.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remember me option depends on the cookie. So this will works on the browsers which accepts cookie. Usually your Sinatra application will store only one cookie ie., session cookie. But for implementing the remember me option we&nbsp; need to manually create and save another cookie which is used to track the user logged in. <br /><br />The Working<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Remember me option will be used by those who hate login process.For those guys we need to keep their session alive for a certain extend, about 1 week or 2 week. So even when the browser is closed their session should be alive. But the session cookie will expire when the browser closes or inactivity for about 1-2 hours. So to over these we need to introduce a new cookie "rememberme" which will store the username in the encrypted format. Then while they reach the login page we need to check the "rememberme" cookie as well. So if this cookie is present we will redirect them to their home page instead of login page.</div>
